									<h2>Brief Project Description</h2>
									<p>Here some of the past and current projects on assesssing broadband connectivity options as well as the role of
										Internet in improving climate change resilience.</p>

											<h3>Mobile Broadband Geospatial Model</h3>
											<p>With over 2.6 billion still unconnected to the Internet, new mobile technology systems including 5G and 6G will be
												crucial in narrowing digital divide, thanks to higher penetration of smartphones. This model evaluates and compares 
												the capacity, coverage, cost and environmental impact of connecting the unconnected using 4G and 5G.</p>
										</li>

											<h3>Broadband Connectivity and Climate Change Resilience</h3>
											<p>While there has been a greater focus on quantifying the relationship between poverty and natural hazard vulnerability, 
												no existing analysis quantifies these effects when also considering cellphone coverage (given cellphones provide a 
												strong mitigation strategy via early warning messages). This is further compounded by the lack of open source 
												geospatial data on the number of unconnected people at a global scale. One proxy for quantifying the number 
												of unconnected users, is information on those regions uncovered by existing mobile cellular technologies, 
												such as 2G, 3G or 4G.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="https://github.com/Bonface-Osoro/glassfiber"><img src="images/demand_metrics.png" alt="" class="left" /></a>
											<h3>Fixed Fiber Broadband</h3>
											<p>Fixed fiber provides an option for connecting some of the unconnected areas through innovative network layout 
												such as Fiber-to-the Neighborhood (FTTnb) architecture. Unlike satellite, fixed fiber is considered as one of 
												the greenest forms of broadband capable of providing descent speeds. Here an open source integrated geospatial 
												model is developed for estimating the capacity, coverage, cost and emissions of fixed fiber broadband systems 
												in connecting the population below the poverty line and uncovered population in rural areas.</p>

									<h3>Space in Africa</h3>
									<p>Reports of vandalism of metal parts at the defunct Longonot Earth Station was a low point for the Kenyan space community. 
										ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru’s response on Twitter was even more disheartening. His response was that the facility 
										has been non-operational for decades and he does not manage private companies since it is now in the hands of Telkom Kenya. 
										While it is true that the facility is outdated, there are proposals to convert it to a radio astronomy research facility. 
										Such conversion has been done in Ghana in collaboration with the South African government.
										
										In a bid to prove to the world’s largest science instrument project, Square Kilometre Array (SKA), South Africa promised to 
										build pre-cursor telescopes in the country and the rest of Africa to help investigate secrets of the universe.
										
										Are we alone in the universe? Was Einstein right? What happened before the formation of stars and planets? These are some of 
										the questions that South Africa and the SKA project seek to answer. In the spirit of Ubuntu, as they say in South Africa, 
										the project extended collaboration to other eight African countries. These are Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Ghana, Mozambique, 
										Madagascar, Zambia and Mauritius..</p>
